# Project Overview

This project analyzes player behavior and performance patterns in a gaming environment to identify trends, risks, and opportunities for improving player engagement. Using Excel for data cleaning, calculations, and charting, and PowerPoint for presenting findings, the analysis highlights key drivers of player activity and churn.

**Key Questions Analyzed**

* What are the main factors influencing player engagement?

* Which player segments are most at risk of churn?

* How do different gameplay features impact user retention?

* What recommendations can be made to improve long-term player satisfaction?

**Tools & Files**

Excel → Data cleaning, analysis, and chart creation.

PowerPoint (PDF) → Final presentation with insights and recommendations.

**Recommendations**

Focus retention efforts on players in their first 3–6 months, as churn risk is highest during this period.

Introduce loyalty rewards or in-game incentives to improve engagement for high-churn segments.

Monitor player satisfaction by geography, as churn trends varied by region.

Use churn prediction insights to guide marketing strategies and improve customer lifetime value.
